.. math::

    \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{F} = -G^0 \\
    \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{P} = -\vec{G}
..

where :math:`E` is the radiation energy density, :math:`F` is the radiation flux,
:math:`P` is the radiation pressure tensor, and :math:`G` is the radiation four-force.
