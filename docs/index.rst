Welcome to Quokka's documentation!
========================================

Quokka is a high-resolution shock capturing AMR radiation hydrodynamics code using the AMReX
library :cite:`AMReX_JOSS` to provide patch-based adaptive mesh functionality.
We take advantage of the C++ loop abstractions in AMReX in order to
run with high performance on either CPUs or GPUs.
